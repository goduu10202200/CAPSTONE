                <p class="text-left text-introduction mb-3">
                    Capstone is passionate about inclusivity, equity, and accessibility for the benefit of all kids.
                    Reading is everywhere.
                    We read for functional reasons—a road sign, a recipe, text messages. We read to develop a better
                    understanding about
                    matters big and small. We read to be inspired by new ideas, experiences, storylines, and points of
                    view.

                    Our infinite variety of readers deserve books that reflect them—their interests, their abilities,
                    their cultures, their
                    families, their traditions—and inspire them to be curious and informed about the world around them.

                    Whether it’s printed, digital, audio, or visual, kids need options and resources to learn in the way
                    that is right for
                    them. They need to be immersed in stories and facts about the world around them and develop the
                    critical thinking skills
                    to make sense of it all. It is essential for kids to see themselves in those stories to feel
                    connected and to grow and
                    learn.

                    There should be no
                    barriers to reading. Kids should be able to access books that speak to their curiosity, their
                    experiences, their
                    imagination, and of course, their heart. Reading is incredibly important for early age and childhood
                    development, and
                    every day we commit to that.
